# Beacon

![app image](assets/images/large.png)

## Introduction
This app integrate the basic flows for BLE beacons into Homey.
Once the app is installed it will do a discovery of BLE devices, after a short adjustable timeout it wil keep discovering.
After each discovery the app compares the found devices with the one paired.
If the beacon is not found within the new "discovered list" the beacon is changed in state. 

For filtering out false positives there is a verification amount inside or outside the range available in the settings.
This setting is the amount of times the beacon needs to be changed before it wil marked as such. The amount will be reset if the beacon is not in that current state.

## Supported devices:
* Generic BLE beacon (every BLE device that is public discoverable)

#### Tested devices
Here is a list of used devices

|Beacon name|Max range (through concrete)|
| --- | --- |
|*Tile Pro 2018*|*8m*|
|*Tile Mate 2018*|*8m*|
|*Nordic nRF51822*|*5m*|
|*Keeper*|*8m*|
|*iTag*|*5m*|
|*Nedis mini*|*3m*|
|*Lapa*|*?m*

> WARNING: The tile pro 2020 does not work because it is not publicly discoverable

## Usage
1. Install app
2. Make the device discoverable.
2. Add device(s) to Homey.
4. Make a flow with one of the cards.

## Settings
There are some settings to improve and tweak the app's behaviour.
> NOTE: Changing these settings can result into an unstable situation. 

#### Update settings
The delay between reading sensor values in seconds. (default 15 seconds)

#### VerificationAmountInside
The amount of verifications the app need to mark a beacon inside the range. (1 time)

#### VerificationAmountOutside
The amount of verifications the app need to mark a beacon outside the range. (5 times)

## Cards
An overview of all the trigger cards that can be used

| Type | Context | Name | Tokens |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Trigger | Global | A beacon detected state is changed | (beacon name, detected) |
| Trigger | Global | A beacon is inside range | (beacon name) |
| Trigger | Global | A beacon is outside range | (beacon name) |
| Trigger | Global | A beacon has been discovered | (beacon name, uuid) |
| Trigger | Global | Update beacon presence | - |
| Trigger | Global | The beacon detected state is changed | (beacon name, detected) |
| Trigger | Global | The app generates a log | (log) |
| Condition | Global | The beacon is inside range | beacon name |
| Condition | Global | The beacon is outside range | beacon name |
| Action | Global | Update all the beacon presence |
